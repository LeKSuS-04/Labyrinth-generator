# Maze-generator

Simple tool for generating mazes, written in Haskell. Here's example of it's
output:
![Example of maze, generated by this tool](screenshots/example.png)

## Usage
Use `cabal` build tool for managing this project. Following command will
install all dependencies, compile and run project. More information can
be found inside [maze-generator.cabal](./maze-generator.cabal) file.
```bash
$ cabal run
```
You can configure width and height of maze in [Main.hs](app/Main.hs) file. 
Unfortunately no other ways exist for configuration of behaviour of program.
As for now, I'm not planning on implementing any.

* [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) - build tool
